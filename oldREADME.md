# SMT-Hardcore
### Adds death and damage to Supermarket Together
Currently Implemented (Non-Features):
- Pressing "h" on the keyboard deals 10 damage (for debug)
- An utterly insane amount of console outputs for debug
Currently Implemented (FEATURES):
- Getting hit with broom deals 10 damage
- Health Bar at top of screen

Future Implementations:
- Products not found deals damage
- Products too expensive deals damage
- Products stolen deals damage
- Deleting things in the store deals damage
- Running out of health sends to jail
- Running out of health loses money
- Probably more at some point, gotta learn how to do the rest first

Credits:
- Damntry for teaching me how to do this and implementing a good portion of the project
- Mitche for providing the required functions to tap into to trigger damage
